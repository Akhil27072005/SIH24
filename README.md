# Smart India Hackathon 2024 Project

This repository contains the documentation and proof of work for our hackathon project.

### üìù Project Description

We built a prototype of a mobile app enabling farmers to sell their produce directly to the market, without the need for a middleman. This improves their profits and streamlines the farm-to-market process. Our team successfully progressed to the second round of the hackathon with this concept.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technology Used

This prototype was developed using **FlutterFlow** to rapidly build and demonstrate the core application flow and user interface. As a result, this repository does not contain traditional source code files.

### üé• Video Demonstration

The primary proof of work is our video demonstration, which shows the prototype app in action.
